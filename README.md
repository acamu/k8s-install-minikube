Example Playbook Role Usage
----------------

    User: "mynewUser"
    Password: secret
    Home Directory: /home/userdirectory
    Shell: /bin/bash

We we're creating a "regular" user, one that can login. That user will likely assigned to an UID of 1000 or greater.

The Ansible task file with a user definition which uses the "
[user module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/user_module.html)" to create a user:

    
    ---
    - name: Create a login user
     user:
      name: newUser
      password: '???'
      groups: # Empty by default, here we give it some groups
       - sudo
      state: present
      shell: /bin/bash       # Defaults to /bin/bash
      system: no             # Defaults to no
      createhome: yes        # Defaults to yes
      home: /home/newUser  # Defaults to /home/<username>


I little more about tasks **definition**
<pre><code><b>name</b>: Set the username (the primary group they belong to will be the same).
<b>password</b>: Set the password.
<b>groups</b>: Assign secondary groups. Their "sudo" (group sudo allows the user to run sudo commands on Ubuntu and Debian linux or CentOS).
<b>state</b>: Tell ansible we want the user to exist.
<b>shell</b>: You can define any shell. The default is /bin/bash.
<b>system</b>: Set this to "yes" to make it a system user. No shell or home directory will be made unless specified otherwise.
<b>createhome</b>: Yes to create a home directory, no to not create one
<b>home</b>: If you don't want to use the default location, set it here
</pre></code>
